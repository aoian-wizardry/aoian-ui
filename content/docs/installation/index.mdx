## Prerequisites

aoian ui is built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), so you'll need to set it up first:

1. Follow the [shadcn/ui installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to set up shadcn/ui in your project
2. Install the base components you need from shadcn/ui using their CLI
3. Get familiar with how shadcn/ui works - our components follow the same philosophy

## Installing Components

Once you have shadcn/ui set up, two steps of operations are required:

1. Initialize aoian ui. It will install CSS variables and modify the Tailwind CSS configuration.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.aoian.chat/r/index
```

2. Install aoian ui components such as the "bubble" component.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.aoian.chat/r/bubble
```

This will:

1. Copy the component to your project
2. Add all required npm dependencies
3. Add any required shadcn/ui components that the component depends on
